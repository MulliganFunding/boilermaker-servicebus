## Message Lock Renewal

For long-running tasks that may exceed Azure Service Bus message lock duration, it's possible to use `renew_message_lock()` to maintain exclusive access to the message (and prevent it from being redelivered):

```python
@app.task()
async def process_large_file(state, file_path: str):
    """Process a large file with periodic lock renewal."""

    lines = await read_file_lines(file_path)

    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        await process_line(line)

        # Renew message lock every 50 lines
        if i % 50 == 0:
            await state.app.renew_message_lock()

    return f"Processed {len(lines)} lines"
```

!!! note "More information"
    Use message lock renewal for tasks that take longer than the message-lease duration for your queue.

    Consult the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-transfers-locks-settlement#peeklock) for more information.
